The districts that will be affected the most by our budget cuts are:

0200210, 0401050, 0402430,0404720, and 0405820.

# Problem 2

Ideally we would like to see the same race porportion distribution between districts that had their budgets reduced and those districts that did not have their budgets reduced. The reason we would like these two distributions to be the same is to ensure that district budgets aren't affected by an underlying racial bias. Unfortunately, the way in which I decided to create budget cuts did not ensure that racial distributions were the same between the two different types of districts.

Actually, there appears to be very little in terms of Schools with IEP under IDEA students that are affected by the budget reductions. This obviously is biased, but may not be a bad thing in this instance. More funding might be necessary for IEP under IDEA students and thus, not cutting districts with IEP students would be a good thing.

# Problem 4
I looked at Omair Shafi Ahmed's  questions 4 and 5 from HW3 https://github.com/Omairss/ds5500-hw3. He justified his method because it would save 15,000 schools from having to make budget cuts. Additionally, he justified his method by because at a maximum, the schools that did have budget cuts only saw 20% cut. The advantage of this is that there is only a small number of schools that are affected. The disadvantage is that a 20% cut can be costly, that could amount to more than 4 teacher salaries which to them is a huge factor. Additionally, this method did not take into account performance, or demographic attributes when determining which schools will receive a reduction. As a result, there may exist underlying biases associated with cuts that were not considered.

# Problem 5
The special lecture topic I found most interesting was the MapReduce lecture. Jan Vitek examined the motivation being MapReduce, how it works, and how it is used today. Big data makes it increasing hard for single computers to store and process data. As a result, methods to parrellelize distribution and ensure fault tolerance were needed. This is what MapReduce does. This evolved into other methods that Google and other major information giants have created to optimize their parrellelization for their specific needs.
